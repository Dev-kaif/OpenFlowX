## What is OpenFlowX?

OpenFlowX lets you **build, run, and manage workflows visually** using nodes and connections.

Think of it as:

- A **visual automation builder**
- With **AI-native nodes**
- Designed for **developers and non-developers alike**
- Fully **self-hostable & open-source**

You can automate repetitive tasks, integrate services, trigger AI actions, and connect systems together — all through a node-based UI.

---

## Who is it for?

OpenFlowX is for:

- Developers who want automation without boilerplate
- Builders experimenting with AI workflows
- Indie hackers & startups
- Anyone who wants to automate tasks without building everything from scratch

If you’ve ever thought _“I wish I could just connect these things together visually”_ — this is for you.
